    <h3>Ideal for Halloween, this "horrible hand" ham and cheese board will be the life of your party.</h3>
        <h3>his exceptionally creepy skinned hand is best served very cold, with crackers, hot sauce</h3> 
        <h3>"blood"—and a dagger.</h3>
        <p>Every year around this time, I like to joke about how scary, terrifying, and spooky Halloween foods </p>
        <p>are never actually any of those things. They’re goofy, funny, and sometimes gross, but they never actually scare someone. </p>
        <p>Well, this “Horrible Hand” Ham and Cheese Board may be the exception.
        <p>not my version, since I don’t have the sculpting skills, or anatomical knowledge to create a truly realistic skinned and amputated hand, but you might, and I hope you do.</p>

                <li>1/3 cup finely chopped fresh italian parsley</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon greshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayene pepper</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Recipe</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Add cream cheese, red pepper, parsley, black pepper, 
                    garlic powder, salt, and cayenne to a bowl and mix thoroughly.
                     Cover surface with plastic wrap, and chill until firm,
                      about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>
                    Trace your hand on a piece of parchment. Turn parchment over, and place on a baking sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use two teaspoons to fill in the hand template with the chilled cheese mixture. Build cheese up in appropriate spots to form the 3-dimensional shape of a hand and wrist.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until very firm, about 1 hour. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use a knife to separate fingers from hand and hand from wrist. Wrap each piece with prosciutto, tucking extra meat underneath. Cover, and place in freezer about 1 hour, or until ready to complete assembling the hand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the hand section on a serving board first, then attach the fingers and the wrist. Use your own hand as a reference for placing parts of the hand. Use more prosciutto to cover seams, and to add detail and definition. Refrigerate until ready to serve. 
                </li>
            </ol>
